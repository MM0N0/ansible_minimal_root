app_ctrl
=========
With this role you can change the application state via commands. the role will wait until the stop/start was successful.

This role should only be used for small playbooks to trigger stop or start of an application.
It is not meant to be used in declarative master playbooks.

**make sure you use the syntax from the example playbook**

**don't** set vars like this:

        - role: run_cmd

          vars:
            cmds:
            - "echo 'HELLO WORLD'"
            - "pwd"


        - role: run_cmd
          vars:
            cmds: []

vars are set globally, so the last declaration in the playbook is valid. In this case no commands will be executed, because cmds is set to [] in the last declaration.

**If you set vars like this, it will work as expected:**

        - role: run_cmd
          cmds:
            - "echo 'HELLO WORLD'"
            - "pwd"


        - role: run_cmd
          cmds: []
